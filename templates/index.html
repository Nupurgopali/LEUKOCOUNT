<p class="para"> LEUKOCOUNT aids in automating the process of detecting and counting different
types of WBC's in a blood smear.White blood cell (WBC) count is a valuable metric 
for assisting with diagnosis or prognosis of various diseases such as coronary heart disease,
 type 2 diabetes, or infection. In the current pandemic situation, with number of
patients increasing exponentially each day. It is difficult to manually count and keep
track of their white blood cells.It is crucial to maintain ideal count of white blood cells,
drastic decrease in the number of WBC's leads to higher risk of getting an infection and an 
abnormal increase in the number could indicated diseases such as bone-marrow, cancer, etc.</p>
<p class="para">Apart from this a WBC count can detect hidden infections within your body and alert doctors 
to undiagnosed medical conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, immune deficiencies, 
and blood disorders. This test also helps doctors monitor the effectiveness of 
chemotherapy or radiation treatment in people with cancer.</p>
<p class="para"> Recent studies have revealed that raised white blood cell and 
neutrophil counts along with a fall in lymphocyte count are seen in some patients 
with COVID-19. Other studies have shown that determining the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte 
ratio could serve as a biomarker that could predict the infection's outcome.</p>
<p class="para">wbCOUNT using deep learning techniques to detect four different
types of WBC's :
<p class="para">
<li class="para">'EOSINOPHIL'</li>
<li class="para">'LYMPHOCYTE'</li>
<li class="para">'MONOCYTE'</li>
<li class="para">'NEUTROPHIL'</li>

<p class="para">and counts each type of WBC's
present in the sample.It attempts in making the entire process of detecting and counting number 
of WBC's efficient, effortless, cheap and timing-saving.</p></p>

<h2 class="h1">HOW IT WORKS</h2>
<p class="para">There are numerous methods and principles to manually count WBCs such as the TLC method,etc.
It usually takes few days to weeks time to detect and count different types of WBC's in a sample.
It even requires expensive medical instruments to manually count different types of WBC'c.</p>
<p class="para"> Here's where LEUKOCOUNT helps as it makes the entire process cheaper( since no medical tools
are required) and faster. It instantly provides result on a large scale of blood samples, saving
hospital's/clinic's time and expense.</p>
<p class="para"> LEUKOCOUNT takes the blood samples snapshots as input and uses image processing techinques
to count different types of WBC's and then provides a graph indicate number of different 
types of WBC's present in the blood sample.</p>
